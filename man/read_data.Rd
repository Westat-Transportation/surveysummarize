\title{Read HTS data and weights.}
\usage{
read_data(config)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{The study year of the dataset. Currently supports "2001" and "2009".}

\item{select}{A character vector of NHTS variable names to select for analysis. Defaults to all variables in the codebook.}

\item{csv_path}{The parent directory of "/csv/dataset/". Defaults to working directory.}
}
\value{
read_data returns an object of class "HTS.data". It contains the data files and weights necessary for
querying the NHTS dataset, used primarily by \link[summarizeNHTS]{summarize_data}.

The "HTS.data" object is essentially a list of data.tables broken up by data and weights.

Accessing the data:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{household} - Household data file
  \item \strong{person} - Person data file
  \item \strong{trip} - Trip data file
  \item \strong{vehicle} - Vehicle data file
}

Accessing the weights:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{household} - Household weight file. Used for weighting household and vehicle data.
  \item \strong{person} - Person weight file. Also includes trip weights at the person level.
}
}
\description{
Read HTS data and weights.
}
\details{
\code{read_data} is a wrapper for reading in variables from the correct csvs
and merging the corresponding tables on correct keys. \link[data.table]{fread} and
\link[data.table]{merge} are used for performance benefits.

\examples{
\donttest{
# Read 2009 NHTS data with specified csv path:
nhts_data <- read_data('2009', csv_path = 'C:/NHTS')

# Access the data
nhts_data$data$household     # household data
nhts_data$data$person        # person data
nhts_data$data$trip          # trip data
nhts_data$data$vehicle       # vehicle data

# Access the weights
nhts_data$weights$household  # household weights
nhts_data$weights$person     # person and trip weights
