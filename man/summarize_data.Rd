\usage{
summarize_data(data, agg, agg_var = NULL, by = NULL, subset = NULL,
  prop = FALSE, prop_by = NULL, exclude_missing = FALSE,
  use_labels = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Object returned by \link[summarizeNHTS]{read_data}.}

\item{agg}{Aggregate function label. Either "household_count", "person_count", "trip_count",
"sum", "avg", "median", "household_trip_rate", or "person_trip_rate". See \emph{Aggregates} section}

\item{agg_var}{Character string specifying a numeric variable over which to aggregate.
Only relavent when agg is "avg" or "sum"}

\item{by}{Character vector of one or more variable names to group by. See \emph{Analysis Groups} section.}

\item{subset}{Character string containing a pre-aggregation subset condition using \link[data.table]{data.table} syntax.
See \emph{Filter} section.}

\item{prop}{logical. Use proportions for count aggregates?}

\item{prop_by}{Character vector of one or more variable names by which to group proportions.}

\item{exclude_missing}{logical. Exclude missing responses from summary.}

\item{label}{logical. Use labels for table output?}
}
\value{
data.table object aggregated by input specifications containing the following fields:

\itemize{
  \item \code{by} variables. For each \code{by} variable, a column of the same name is created.
  They will appear in the order they are listed as \link[base]{factors} ordered by their codebook values.
  \item \strong{W} - Weighted statistic.
  \item \strong{E} - Standard error of the weighted statistic.
  \item \strong{S} - Surveyed/sampled statistic.
  \item \strong{N} - Number of observations/sample size.
}
}
\description{
Create weighted aggregate tables using NHTS data.

\section{Aggregates (\code{agg})}{

What type of aggregate are you interested in?

\subsection{Frequencies / Proportions}{
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{household_count} - Count of households
    \item \strong{person_count} - Count of persons
    \item \strong{trip_count} - Count of trips
    \item \strong{vehicle_count} - Count of vehicles
  }
  \emph{*Use} \code{prop = TRUE} \emph{in combination with a count aggregate to get the proportion.}
}

\subsection{Numeric Aggregates (Sum / Average / Median)}{
  \emph{Must also specify a numeric aggregate variable using the} \code{agg_var} \emph{parameter.}
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{sum} - Sum of \code{agg_var}
    \item \strong{avg} - Arithmetic mean of \code{agg_var}
    \item \strong{median} - Median of \code{agg_var}
  }
}

\subsection{Trip Rates (Daily Person Trips per Person/Household)}{
  Simply put, the count of trips divided by the count of persons or households.
  \itemize{
    \item \strong{household_trip_rate} - Daily trips per household.
    \item \strong{person_trip_rate} - Daily trips per person.
  }
}
}

\section{Analysis Groups (\code{by})}{

By which variables to you wish to aggregate?

Similar to \code{GROUP BY} in SQL or a \code{CLASS} statement in SAS.
There is no limit to the number of variables specified in the character vector, however many \code{by} variables
can result in groups with small sample sizes which need to be interpreted carefully.

The data.table returned by summarize_data will include a column (of class \link[base]{factor}) for each \code{by} variable specified.

\examples{
\donttest{
# Read 2009 NHTS data with specified csv path:
nhts_data <- read_data('2009', csv_path = 'C:/NHTS')

summarize_data(
  data = nhts_data,           # Using the nhts_data object,
  agg = 'person_trip_rate',   # calculate the person trip rate
  by = 'WORKER',              # by worker status
  subset = 'CENSUS_R == "01"' # for households in the NE Census region
)
}
